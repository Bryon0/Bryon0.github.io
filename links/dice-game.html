		<h3>Rules of the game</h3>
		<p>
			<!-- Here is a very simple overview of how the game is played. -->
			This is a turn based game, in which each round a player has up to three rolls per turn.
			Each roll, the player can set aside any number of dice and roll the remaining in order 
			to get a certain combination of numbers. After the last roll you will have to add up the
			maximum potential points that are still available to score.
		</p>
